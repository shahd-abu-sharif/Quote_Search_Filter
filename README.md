# Quote_Search_Filter
A simple search filter using _JavaScript_.
It's a _basic HTML_ page that fetches quote data from an API and displays quote texts. 
If the user enters a string in the text field, the application should show **only quotes whose text contains the entered string**.


1. The *Dummy JSON API* was used to fetch quote data.: **https://dummyjson.com/quotes** .
2. HTML page displays the quote texts as a *list*.
3. Implement a text input field that allows the user to filter the quote list by entering a string. 
   >> *The filter only display quotes whose text contains the entered substring*

4. The data has been fetched from the API *only once*, and the results is *filtered using JavaScript* .
5. Display an *error message* if the API call fails.
